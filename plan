look into mdp constraints
reward shaping


OPTIONS :

 * Shielding policy: having safety constraints, and if they're not verified, we replace the action by one produced by a safe (sub-optimal) policy.

 * Reward Shaping : look into that. give negative feedback to deceptive policies.

 * Prevent deceptive actions to be explored. (perhaps keep track of actions that were deceptive and revert them).

 other:
 
 * actor critic? constrained mdp?


Reward-Shaping : wrap the utility function in an object that adds C < 0 to the utility if the policy is detected as negative.

Shield : wrap the policy in shielded policy that, before executing an action, checks that it's not deceptive, and if it is, do somethign else.
